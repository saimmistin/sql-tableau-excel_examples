#In my project I have retrieved several data from MySQL and have visualized them on Tableau. Data is about employees information of a 
company and contains approximately 1000000 records. I have completed several tasks on that project.





#Task1
Create a visualization that provides a breakdown between the male and female employees working in the company each year, starting from 1990. 


SELECT 
	ee.gender,
    d.dept_name,
    calender_year,
    ROUND(AVG(s.salary),2) AS salary
FROM
	(SELECT
		YEAR(hire_date) AS calender_year
	FROM 
		t_employees
	GROUP BY calender_year) e
		CROSS JOIN
	t_dept_emp de
		JOIN
	t_departments d ON de.dept_no = d.dept_no
		JOIN
	t_employees ee ON de.emp_no = ee.emp_no
		JOIN
	t_salaries s ON de.emp_no = s.emp_no
ORDER BY calender_year;





'''
Task2
Compare the number of male managers to the number of female managers from different departments for each year, starting from 1990.
'''

SELECT 
    d.dept_name, ee.gender, dm.emp_no, dm.from_date, dm.to_date, e.calendar_year,
    
    CASE
        WHEN YEAR(dm.to_date) >= e.calendar_year AND YEAR(dm.from_date) <= e.calendar_year THEN 1
        ELSE 0
    END AS active
FROM
    (SELECT 
        YEAR(hire_date) AS calendar_year
    FROM
        t_employees
    GROUP BY calendar_year) e
        CROSS JOIN
    t_dept_manager dm
        JOIN
    t_departments d ON dm.dept_no = d.dept_no
        JOIN 
    t_employees ee ON dm.emp_no = ee.emp_no
ORDER BY dm.emp_no, calendar_year;




#Task 3 
Compare the average salary of female versus male employees in the entire company until year 2002, and add a filter allowing you 
to see that per each department


SELECT
	e.gender,
    d.dept_name,
    ROUND(AVG(s.salary),2) as avg_salary,
    YEAR(s.from_date) as calendar_year
FROM
	t_salaries s
		JOIN
	t_employees e ON s.emp_no = e.emp_no
		JOIN
	t_dept_emp de ON de.emp_no = e.emp_no
		JOIN
	t_departments d ON d.dept_no = de.dept_no
GROUP BY d.dept_no, e.gender, calendar_year
HAVING calendar_year <= 2002
ORDER BY d.dept_no;



#Task 4 
Create an SQL stored procedure that will allow you to obtain the average male and female salary per department within a certain salary range.
Let this range be defined by two values the user can insert when calling the procedure.


SELECT MIN(salary) FROM t_salaries;
SELECT MAX(salary) FROM t_salaries;
DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS filter_salary;
DELIMITER $$
CREATE PROCEDURE filter_salary (IN p_min_salary FLOAT, IN p_max_salary FLOAT)
BEGIN
SELECT 
    e.gender, d.dept_name, AVG(s.salary) as avg_salary
FROM
    t_salaries s
        JOIN
    t_employees e ON s.emp_no = e.emp_no
        JOIN
    t_dept_emp de ON de.emp_no = e.emp_no
        JOIN
    t_departments d ON d.dept_no = de.dept_no
    WHERE s.salary BETWEEN p_min_salary AND p_max_salary
GROUP BY d.dept_no, e.gender;
END$$
DELIMITER ;
CALL filter_salary(50000, 90000);
